# PCOS Detection Using Ultrasound Images

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model for the accurate detection of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using ultrasound images. This model aims to assist healthcare professionals in the early diagnosis and management of PCOS, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## Tasks
- ### Data Collection & Preparation:

- Collect and preprocess a dataset of ultrasound images.
- Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Apply data augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the dataset.

- ### Model Development:

- Implement the MobileNetV2 architecture for image classification.
- Fine-tune the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model on the PCOS ultrasound dataset.
- Optimize the model using techniques like dropout, regularization, and learning rate adjustments.

- ### Model Training & Evaluation:

- Train the model on the training set and validate it using the validation set.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Generate a classification report and confusion matrix to assess the model's performance.

- ### Model Deployment:

- Create a web application for users to upload ultrasound images and receive predictions.
- Deploy the model on a cloud platform to make it accessible to users.

- ### Documentation & Reporting:

- Document the entire process, including the data preprocessing steps, model architecture, training process, and evaluation results.
- Provide detailed explanations and justifications for the choices made during the project.
- Create a user guide for the web application, including instructions for uploading images and interpreting results.

## Steps

## 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Gather ultrasound images related to PCOS.
- Preprocess the images (resizing, normalization, augmentation).
- Split the data into train, validation, and test sets.

## 2. Model Implementation
- Load the MobileNetV2 pre-trained model.
- Replace the final classification layer with a custom layer suitable for binary classification.
- Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy).
  
## 3. Model Training
- Train the model on the training set.
- Monitor the model's performance on the validation set.
- Adjust hyperparameters to improve performance.
- Save the best-performing model based on validation accuracy.
  
## 4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model on the test set.
Generate performance metrics and a classification report.
Visualize the confusion matrix.

## 5. Deployment
Develop a web application using a framework like Flask or Streamlit.
Integrate the trained model into the web application.
Deploy the application on a cloud service like AWS, Heroku, or Azure.

## 6. Documentation
Document the project in the README.md file.
Include details on how to set up the project locally.
Provide a user manual for the deployed web application.
